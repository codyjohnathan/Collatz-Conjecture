# Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

# Aims of Project:
Further explore the uses of Recursion utilising a mathematical conjecture: 

- Base Case

- 2 Recursive conditions based on if the number is odd or even

- Global variable

Learning Outcomes: 
- Gained a firmer grasp on effectively using recursion to elegantly solve problems
- Successfully wrote a clean and understandable function for the Collatz conjecture that handles all cases
- Affirmed understanding of effectively using memory addresses in C with scanf()
